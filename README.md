# DistributedProgramming
The Aim of this project is to get hands-on practice on how distributed client-server application works with a remote RMI server accepts and executes the query on a client.
-> The queries performed are 
1. Checking the directory depth from a given folder in a  directory tree.
2. Listing the directory path for a given file name if present.
3. List all the sub-folders in a given folder.

Knowledge Gained: 
  1. Got deep understanding of distributed file system architecure and how it is helpful to query and access the data from a server which is remote.
  2. This Distributed environment enabled query access of the files and content instead of downloading the data everytime.
